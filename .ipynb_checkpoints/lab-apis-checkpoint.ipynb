    "\n",
    "**Objective:** \n",
    "Uncover new music by exploring the top tracks of your favorite artists and their related artists.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Instructions:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **List Your Favorite Artists**:\n",
    "    - Make a list of your three favorite artists and store it in a variable named `artists`.\n",
    "    - Example: `artists = [\"Los Fabulosos Cadillacs\", \"Manu Chao\", \"Muchachito Bombo Infierno\"]`.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Fetch Top Tracks**:\n",
    "    - Write a function named `get_top_tracks`.\n",
    "    - This function should accept an artist's name and return the name of the first 5 top tracks by that artist.\n",
    "    - Use the function `get_top_tracks` to get the first 5 top tracks for each artist in your `artists` list and store the results in a new list named `top_tracks_list`.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Discover Related Artists**:\n",
    "    - Write a function named `find_related_artists`.\n",
    "    - This function should accept an artist's name and return the names of the first 5 artists related to the provided artist.\n",
    "    - Store the results in a list named `related_artists_list`.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Challenge:** \n",
    "Combine the above steps to create a playlist that includes the top tracks of your favorite artists and the top tracks of the artists related to them."

   "source": [
    "**Hint Section for 3. **Discover Related Artists**:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Getting Artist ID**:\n",
    "    - Remember that every artist on Spotify has a unique identifier: their `id`. To get the related artists, you first need to fetch the ID of the given artist.\n",
    "    - Consider using the `sp.search` method to query the artist's name. The method requires a `q` parameter, which is your query (in this case, the artist's name). It also has a `limit` parameter, which specifies the number of tracks it returns. In this case, 1 track is enough, since we just want the artist ID. \n",
    "    - Each track in the results has an associated 'artists' field. This field is a list containing details about all artists involved in that track.\n",
    "   - For most tracks, especially those by a single artist, this list will contain one artist. From this artist's details, you can extract the 'id' field, which is the unique identifier for that artist on Spotify.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Fetching Related Artists**:\n",
    "    - Once you have the artist's ID, you can use another SpotiPy method to fetch related artists. Think about which SpotiPy method allows you to get related artists using an artist's ID. Here is the documentation link: https://spotipy.readthedocs.io/en/2.22.1/. \n",
    "    - This method will return a list of related artists. You'll need to extract the relevant details (artist names) from this list.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Iterating for Multiple Artists**:\n",
    "    - Once you have a function that returns related artists names for one artist, you can use a list comprehension to apply this function to a list of artist names.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Testing**:\n",
    "    - Always test your function with one artist name first. Once you're confident it works, then apply it to the entire list.\n",
    "\n",
    "Remember, the key is to break the problem down into manageable steps. Use the SpotiPy documentation as a resource to understand available methods and their return structures."
